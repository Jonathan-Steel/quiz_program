# Recuerda
*by Jonathan Steel*

This project is a quiz-making application designed for anyone who wants to revise facts which uses flashcards to prompt users to recall information.

## Summary

1. Uses the **Flask**, a **Python** framework, to develop the back-end of the website.
2. Powered by a **SQLite** database containing User data and Quiz data. All passwords are hashed by **Bcrypt** hashing algorithm.
3. **HTML templates** power the front end.
4. My custom **CSS** stylesheet styles the website.
5. A **Javascript** script powers the flashcard functionality.

## Issues and Challenges

1. Flask and Jinja syntax does not work well with JS. Lots of syntax issues perhaps I should have used a **JS Framework** such as **React**.
2. Designing the **database** structure to incorporate a chain of many-to-one tables using foreign keys.
3. Moving from a **Boostrap** stylesheet to my custom sheet.
